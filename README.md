# Space-Shift

This is the repository for my portfolio 

## Details

The page was made using Svelte and Open-Props. Rather than a traditional 'wall' style single page, I opted for an accordion setup with each section in its own dropdown. It introduced a number of interesting challenges, but in the end I am really pleased with the outcome. It gives the page a unique look and feel compared to most portfolios while still retaining and serving all the critical information you would expect. 

Thanks for checking it out, feel free to use it as a template for your own portfolio if you want
