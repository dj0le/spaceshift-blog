## Will you read an "Ai" novel?

One of the things I have been really into lately is the emergence of LLM's that can handle very large amounts of tokens. With this capacity, the algorithm is able to ingest a novel sized amount of information and the output becomes much more interesting.

I have been experimenting with different open source and publically available LLM's looking for one that I could 'co-write' with. The main idea, is that I feed it my original works and have it continue them keeping my voice and style.

And, that's the challenge. It's pretty trivial for an LLM to generate 'story content', but getting it to assume a specific voice is much more difficult. Because of the general datasets that LLMs are trained on, they frequently revert to generic tropes and rehash basic plot-lines.

I think there is a lot of room for 'assistants' that can output work that is consistent with an individuals style and this is my foray into that.

The next entry will be my original short story. I wrote it a few years back, but have never published it, and so I thought it would be a good candidate.

It's called 'Inflection Point', and I hope you enjoy it.
