## Thoughts on the blog

Setting up the blog was a fun challenge and great inspiration to get me to actually make a new (and I think vastly improved) portfolio. So, in that sense, I really am glad I made it. But the truth is,

## I'm not really into it

My plan with this blog is to not just do the usual where I discuss my journey into becoming an actual developer. Rather, I would like to take it in a different approach.

I have written a few novels in the past, and I want to do an experiment with an LLM for story processing, where I feed it only the novels I have written and then post its output as blog entries.

## But that is in the future

First, I need to get a bunch of other stuff finished, so I hope this isn't a project that just falls to the side, but it's definitely one that could.

Wish me luck!
