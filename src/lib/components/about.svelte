<h3>Do you like websites?</h3>
<p>
	I specialize in engaging UI/UX design, front-end development, and copywriting. I enjoy breathing
	life into websites by developing digital experiences around the belief that the web should be
	accessible and inclusive for all.
</p>
<p>
	I primarily code HTML, CSS & JS using Sveltekit, but am capable of using other frameworks. I also
	have extensive knowledge in Wordpress designs and implementations.
</p>
<p>
	I currently live in beatufiul Bosnia & Hercegovina, but am willing to work anywhere world wide.
	Travel or remote are also totally fine. Basically, I am extremely flexible.
</p>
<p>
	Outside of coding, I like to travel, enjoy visual arts and VJing, creative writing, and watching
	people play Age of Empires II online.
