<h2>Do you like websites?</h2>
<p>
	I specialize in engaging UI/UX design, front-end development, and copywriting. I really enjoy
	design and CSS, and making websites come to life. I believe the web should be accessible and
	inclusive for all, and develop digital experiences around that concept.
</p>
<p>
	I primarily code HTML, CSS & JS using Sveltekit, but am capable of using other frameworks. I also
	have extensive knowledge in Wordpress designs and implementations
</p>
<p>
	I currently live in beatufiul Bosnia & Hercegovina, but am willing to work anywhere world wide.
	Travel or remote are also totally fine. Basically, I am extremely flexible.
</p>
<p>
	Outside of coding, I like to travel, enjoy visual arts and VJing, creative writing, and watching
	people play Age of Empires II online.
