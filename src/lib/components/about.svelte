<h3>Do you like websites?</h3>
<p>
	I've always felt at home in the IT industry, but it was in Front End Development where I found the
	perfect combination integrating the technical and the creative.I enjoy breathing life into
	websites by developing digital experiences around the belief that the web should be accessible and
	inclusive for all. If you are searching for a UI Designer or Front End Developer, let's connect:

<div>
	<a class="project-button" href="mailto: josh@space-shift.com" aria-label="email">Contact</a>
</div>
<p>
	I primarily code HTML, CSS & JS using Svelte, but am capable of using other frameworks. I also
	have extensive knowledge in Wordpress designs and implementations.
</p>
<p>
	I currently live in beautiful Bosnia & Hercegovina, but am willing to work anywhere world wide.
	Travel or remote are also totally fine. Basically, I am extremely flexible.
</p>
<p>
	Outside of coding, I like to travel, enjoy visual arts and VJing, machine learning, creative
	writing, and watching people play Age of Empires II online.
